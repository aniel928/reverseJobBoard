				<h3>About Us</h3>
					<p>We are a reverse job board.  You may be familar with regular job boards.  A job is posted, you scour the board for a job that fits you best.  You send your resume in to be reviewed, and you never hear back.  You think to yourself, "There has to be a better way."</br></br>This is where TheReverseJobBoard.com comes in to play.  We bring you a whole new way to experience job seeking.  Instead of hunting through all of the postings, trying to figure out what is best for you, you fill out a short profile, some contact information and then you sit back and wait for opportunity to come knocking on your door.</p>
				<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
					<p>Great question.  After you fill out your profile, you are done (although you are always welcome to update your information).  When a company is looking for someone to hire, and tired of getting resumes where the applicant doesn't meet their needs, they come to us.  With a simple search of job titles, programs used, and specific skills, the company gets a list of qualified applicants.  If you meet the search criteria and the company likes what they see, you can expect a call!</p>
				<h3>Contact Information</h3>
					<p>Although we keep your contact information on file, rest assured it's safe in our hands.  In order for a company to reach out to you via phone or email, or to even see your full resume, they must have a paid account.  This stops the spammers from getting their hands on your contact information.  When you receive a phone call or an email, it's from somebody with a verified paid account through our website.</p>
				<h3>Get Started!</h3>
					<p>So now that you know everything, what do you have to lose?  Get started now with a <a href="register.php">free job seeker account</a>!  </br> Companies can get started now with a <a href="register.php?type=emp">free employer account</a>, where you can search our database to see the amount of hits you get before committing to a paid account.</p>
